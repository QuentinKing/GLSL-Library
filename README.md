# GLSL-Library

### What is it?
This repository will be a continuously updated collection of GLSL shaders I've written just to have as a reference for any future work. Most of this code will be written for reability as opposed to optimization.

### How do I open them?
Each project will have a preview image of the intended output from each shader. By far the easiest way to open these is to install KodeLife which is the IDE I use to write GLSL shaders. By opening the .klproj file in KodeLife you should be able to see the shader real time. Alternatively, I've saved each shader stage as a .glsl file if you want to use them that way, though you will probably have to go through the hassle of setting all the uniforms and parameters.
